# Smart Sensor Project

## Description
This project consists of a smart sensor system with a smoke/gas detector and a DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor. The system displays data on an LCD screen and sounds a buzzer when smoke or gas is detected.

## Hardware Required
- Arduino Uno
- DHT11 Sensor
- MQ2 Gas Sensor
- 16x2 LCD (I2C)
- Buzzer
- Jumper wires

## Installation
1. Download the code from GitHub.
2. Open the Arduino IDE and load the code onto your Arduino board.
3. Connect the components according to the schematic provided.

## How to Use
- The system will continuously monitor the smoke/gas sensor and display temperature and humidity on the LCD.
- The buzzer will sound if smoke or gas is detected.

## Technologies Used
- Arduino IDE
- DHT11 Library
- LiquidCrystal_I2C Library
- MQ2 Gas Sensor
